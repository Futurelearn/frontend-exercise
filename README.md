Front End Developer Assessment
==============================

Please spend no more than 2 hours on this exercise. We do not need fully working examples, we will assess whatever you can achieve within this timeframe.

When completing this exercise, we'd like you to try and make it;

* Responsive
* Accessible
* Performant
* Scalable

* * *

As a learner on FutureLearn, I would like to easily switch between viewing 'Most Popular' and 'Upcoming' courses, in a small modular sidebar area on a page.

* * *

You should build a suitable page layout to accomodate this module in the sidebar, mobile first. In the mobile view, the module will wrap under main content and display at the bottom of the page. You are free to edit the markup as you see appropriate.

The mobile view is 600px and below.

The lists should be numbered and link to the relevant course detail page on the FutureLearn site. They tabs should then toggle to reveal each list.

The look and feel of the module should match the visuals provided in the `visuals` folder.

This exercise should adhere to our Browser Support matrix, available here: https://about.futurelearn.com/browser-support/
